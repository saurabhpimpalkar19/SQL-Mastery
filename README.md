Day-15-Recursive-CTEs

# Day 15 – Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

This section covers **Recursive CTEs**, an advanced SQL concept used to work with hierarchical and recursive data structures.

Recursive CTEs are commonly used in:
- Employee–Manager hierarchies
- Organizational structures
- Parent–Child relationships
- Tree and graph-like data

---

## 🔹 Key Concepts Covered

- Difference between CTE and Recursive CTE
- Anchor member and Recursive member
- UNION ALL usage in recursion
- Level-wise hierarchy generation
- Finding subordinates under a manager
- Building hierarchical paths

---

## 📊 Sample Use Case

Employee table with manager relationships:

- CEO → Managers → Employees → Interns
- Depth of hierarchy is unknown
- Recursive CTE helps traverse this structure efficiently

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcome

After completing this section, you will be able to:
- Write recursive SQL queries confidently
- Solve hierarchy-based interview questions
- Explain recursion logic clearly in interviews
- Handle real-world organizational data

---

## 🛠 Topics Practiced
- WITH RECURSIVE
- Anchor query
- Recursive query
- Hierarchy level calculation
- Self-referencing joins

---

📌 **Note:** Queries are written for learning and interview preparation purposes.
